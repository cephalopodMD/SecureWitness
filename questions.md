# SecureWitness Questions

Are reports posted to a user's account?
Are reports displayed on a public board if they are public?
Are reports only displayed in a user's account if they are private?
Overall, how are reports stored in the system and how are they viewed by the users?

Does permission to view private reports have to be granted or should it be requested?
If requested, who in a group has the ability to do so?

Can members of a group organize reports into folders?
How do users create reports for group members to see?
Where are the folders stored? Are they within a user's account?

What is a bulletin?
What parts of a report can be encrypted? Only the attached files or the whole report if it is private?
When a user searches for a report, will it be displayed if they are not a member of the group to which it belongs?
How is decryption handled? If it is done locally on a machine does that mean that the user must essentially download a program that asks for their decryption key?

How are accounts created?
What kind of powers does the administrator have over user accounts and their associated reports?
